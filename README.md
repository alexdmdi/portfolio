This responsive site is built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap. 
I am currently using AWS to host it on www.alexdiamandi.com

The main purpose of this portfolio site is to help demonstrate some of my skills and creativity.
I am open to suggestions and improvements.


Current projects/web apps:

1. React-Typescript Weather App 
2. "API fun" section. Connects to 2 different free API endpoints and offers inspirational quotes, and suggestions for when you are bored
3. To-do list. Done with vanilla JavaScript.
